## Introduction

This repository showcases the development of a hexapod robot, a six-legged walking robot. The project involves several stages, including design, assembly, servo motor control, inverse trigonometry calculations for motion, servo calibration, and code implementation. The hexapod robot is designed to mimic the movements of insects and perform various walking patterns.

## Hardware

The hardware components used in this project include:
- **Hexapod Design:** The design of the hexapod robot, including its body, legs, and overall structure.
- **Servo Motors:** A total of 18 servo motors are used (3 per leg) to control leg movement.
- **Workshop Components:** All the physical parts and materials acquired from a workshop for building the robot.
- **Electronics:** Necessary electronic components such as an ESP32 microcontroller, motor drivers, and power supply.

## Software

The software aspect of this project involves:
- **Inverse Trigonometry:** Calculations to determine the servo angles required for desired leg motion.
- **Code Implementation:** The code written to control the hexapod robot's movements, walking patterns, and other functionalities. The code is designed to run on an ESP32 microcontroller.

## Calibration

Servo calibration is a crucial step in ensuring precise control of the hexapod robot. Calibration involves determining the servo angles corresponding to specific leg positions and movements. This ensures that the robot can walk, turn, and perform other actions accurately.

## Usage

To use this repository and the hexapod robot:
1. Refer to the documentation and code files for details on building and assembling the hexapod robot.
2. Follow the calibration instructions to ensure accurate leg movement.
3. Use the provided code to control and program the hexapod for various tasks and movements. The code is written for the ESP32 microcontroller.
